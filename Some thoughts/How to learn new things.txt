Recently, I'm thinking about one simple question 'how to learn new things?'. It's a quite simple question for some people,
but for me it's not that obvious.

I'm smart and all the past experience proved that point. When I was in undergraudate, I play all the time either it's video
games, sports, or hiking. But I still get a decent GPA and that's because I can always manage the materials one week or 
even two hours before the test or assignments.

However, this essay is not to brag how smart I am but to discuss how to learn new things for people like me. Since I always
do those thrilling things in each class, I know that no matter how hard are the courses materials I can manage it. Because of
this, I become arragant and lose interest to dig deep in the concepts or examples. So learn new things other than course
materials become very difficult for me especially when I was surround by more 'interesting' stuff. One major consequence
of this bad habit is that I also lost my confidence when facing new circustance or new people. 

It might seem strange or doesn't make sense that because I lost the abality to learn new things my confidence aslo get lost.
I don't quiet sure how many people share the same thoughts as me when they begin to do something. But I'm the kind of person
that needs to be sure about what I'm doing and how to do it. Once I don't know these two things I could easily become 
nervous and dazed.
